[I read somewhere](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-arent-there-more-chin_b_3188946) that chinese take out places outnumbered McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's combined. Howard County isn't shy of the number of chinese take out places but this place has gotten our fair share of business. Tucked into the corner of Enchanted Forest is this small little shop. China Taste offers all the great staples one would look for in a take-out place.

Do you think there are more chinese take-out places than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and Chick-fil-a?
