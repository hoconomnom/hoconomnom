We've covered a couple of restaurants that have found Howard County as a great second home. This particular restaurant is a prime example of that. Hailing all the way from Montreal, this restaurant chose Ellicott City as their first in the US. They have expanded since then across the DelMarVa area and one in Texas. This is the ultimate brunch restaurant. They serve almost everything, from burgers to french toast to crepes to steak. What's brunch without eggs? Well they have plenty of those, their name won't let you forget that, Eggspectation.

Mrs. Nom Nom and I have been going to Eggspectation for a very long time. It's been here in Howard County since 2002. What we like best about this place is it's food and comfortable setting. The restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is their assortment of cakes and pies displayed in the front counter. It is probably one of the smartest things they do, everytime they get me. I'll immediately look forward to the end of the meal getting a slice of cake and a cup of coffee. Just writing this now makes me want dessert.

Eggspectation has something for everyone. Their menu is extensive. They have brunch all day long and a ton of breakfast items. The stuffed french toast is my goto for breakfast food. On our latest trip here, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Nachos. The fried wonton chips are an excellent choice as "nachos" and the aioli is on point. I definitely will be ordering this again and I highly recommend you get them too. The eggspectation burger is my go to when I'm feeling hungry. You can never go wrong having an egg in a burger. For those adventerous burger tasters, the mango burger is pretty interesting. I admit that it does sound strange but it does surprisingly work. Little Nom had an entire kid's menu to choose from and their choice was a cheeseburger and fries. Or might I realistically say, fries with a side of cheeseburger.

I'm still amazed that this Canadian establishment first came here to little old Howard County as their inaugural American location. But honestly, why not Howard County. Try those Ahi Tuna Nachos and let me know what you think.
