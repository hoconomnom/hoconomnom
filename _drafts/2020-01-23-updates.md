The Common Kitchen has been a staple to this website. It always had news to report, as it always had space for more vendors. The time has come that they have reached capacity. I'll be sad, as I won't be able to rely on them for restaurant updates anymore. But here are just a few more updates, an event this saturday and 1 restaurant coming soon. Also a certain axe place is now open.

## Common Kitchen Event - Clarksville

The Common Kitchen will be celebrating it's 11 vendors which marks their full capacity of vendors. The event is from 11am - 3pm, Saturday 1/25. They will be holding a gift basket raffle, will have live music, and plenty of free samples. As of now, their Frozen event will also be at the same day from 11am - 2pm so they'll have something for all the Little Noms out there. See event details for more.

## Gong Cha - Clarksville

I spoke too soon about no more restaurant updates at The Common Kitchen. Gong Cha will be opening in the Common Kitchen in Clarksville. Soon to be opening this spring, this chain has been springing up all over the area. They provide bubble tea from Taiwan. This will be the second store in Howard County. They will be replacing the counter that RoyalTea occupies.
