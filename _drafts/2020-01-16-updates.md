Here's a couple of new openings that sprung up in the area during the past month or two. The last restaurant is now open at the Common Kitchen and a fast food wings place has opened up in Columbia.

## Foodfricana - Clarksville

The Soft Opening has already happened on Saturday 12/31/19 and they are now open for business. The food is looking amazing. Can't wait to try their Jollof Rice and Beef. This marks the last vendor to open in the Common Kitchen.

## America's Best Wings - Columbia

This chain has it's first store in Howard County but is not new to the area. America's Best Wings have opened up in Harper's Choice Village Center off of Harpers Farm Rd. They offer a huge selection of wings. They are now open right next to Maiwand Kabob and Bank of America.

## Burger King - Columbia

Pop Pop Nom Nom has reported that the Burger King [mentioned here]({% post_url 2019-11-21-updates %}) has opened. Located in Columbia at the Palace 9 shopping center off of Centre Park Dr. I wouldn't be surprised if he was waiting for the doors to open on opening day.
