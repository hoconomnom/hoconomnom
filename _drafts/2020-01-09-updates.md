Not as many updates this time. I have a theory that the cold and the holidays are slowing down the amount of new announcements. Don't worry there are plenty of places still coming very soon. Check the [past updates](/categories/update/) in case you missed any. If you're all caught up, today's post has 1 new opening and 1 upcoming.
