Some really cool places in Elkridge have opened up, part of a revitalization of Main Street. Both places are in the same building 5782 Main St, Elkridge, MD 21075. This is just the beginning of plans to bring new life into historic Elkridge.

## Rathskeller - Elkridge
This place is really interesting and I can't wait to come check it out. It is a german bar and restaurant that is on the bottom floor of the building. Their pretzel and cheese dip looks delicious.

In the upstairs of the building is this cozy coffee shop, named after Hurricane Agnes. They offer light food options and an assortment of teas, coffees and espresso drinks.
