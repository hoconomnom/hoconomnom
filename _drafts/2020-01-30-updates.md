## Sushi Q7 - Jessup

Sushi Q7 will be opening in Jessup. This chain of sushi restaurants have been pretty popular, assuming this is the 7th one. We've been to both Sushi Q and Sushi Q2 and they both have been great. This new one will be right on Rt. 1 just north of the intersection with Rt. 32. They will be in the same shopping center as Popeye's and Jimmy Johns.
