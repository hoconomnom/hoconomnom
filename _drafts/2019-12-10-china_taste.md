[I read somewhere](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-arent-there-more-chin_b_3188946) that chinese take out places outnumbered McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's combined. Howard County isn't shy of the number of chinese take out places but this place has gotten our fair share of business. Tucked into the corner of Enchanted Forest is this small little shop. China Taste offers all the great staples one would look for in a chinese take-out place.

Entering China Taste is everything you'd picture it to be. Bright backlit photos of dishes, that you don't know if they really sell them or not, hang from the top. A clear glass door refrigerator hums to the side. A cute section to the right has two 4 person tables that invite users to dine in. A high top bar awaits you when you enter with a friendly staff that seems to always remember their returning customers.

When it comes to food, China Taste has always been spot on. I always go for the quintessential Chinese take-out food, General Tso's Chicken. The chicken is always juicy and tender (the dark meat definitely helps). The sauce is just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness. I always get the dinner special which comes with fried rice, soup, and egg roll. Little Nom always steals my soup and egg roll as they love the wonton soup. Mrs. Nom Nom usually gets a Lo Mein dish. So far, we've never had a bad dish. The portions are great as we always have left overs.

Do you think there are more chinese take-out places in Howard County than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and Chick-fil-a?
