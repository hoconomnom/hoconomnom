To find a Korean shop that isn't on [Korean Way](https://www.marylandkoreanway.com/) or originate from there, is rare. Of all places, this place has roots in Columbus, Ohio. But they are doing something right, having 37 locations in DC and 6 states. This is the fourth location in Maryland, first in Howard County. This restaurant is located on robot statue alley of the mall (is there a real name for this section?). Bibibop provides simple and healthy choices that you customize to build your own bibimbap.

What is bibimbap? I think of it as a Korean Chipotle. You have your protein, your base (rice, salad, or noodles), and then a lot of sides. The best thing about bibimbap is that every ingredient feels very light. Just reading off the sides: egg, cucumber, radish, kale, carrots, cabbage, corn, cheese, and bean sprouts; they all seem great. The sauce is what sets this place apart. Not only do they have 6 different sauces to choose from. They have a sauce station you can go to that you can add more or try a different one.

In a place with tough competition, Bibibop is a nice healthy option that sets itself apart from the rest. I will have to try the free miso soup next time. Have you had Bibibop before? If so, let me know your bowl recipe as I'm still perfecting mine.
