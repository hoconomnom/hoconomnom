To find a Korean shop that isn't on [Korean Way](https://www.marylandkoreanway.com/) or originate from there, is rare. Of all places, this place has roots in Columbus, Ohio. But they are doing something right, having 37 locations in DC and 6 states. This is the fourth location in Maryland, first in Howard County. This restaurant is located on robot statue alley of the mall (is there a real name for this section?). Bibibop provides simple and healthy choices that you customize to build your own bibimbap.

What is bibimbap? I think of it as a Korean Chipotle. You have your protein, your base (rice, salad, or noodles), and then a lot of sides.
