During this Coronavirus pandemic, restaurant closure mandates, and troubling economy, here's how our community is dealing. I'll try to keep this post updated when I come across more things.

* **Beef Brothers Deli** - Offering No Contact Curbside pick up. If you order online or on the phone, pay in advance, and describe the car. Just pop the trunk when you arrive and someone with gloves will deliver your food and place it in the trunk for you without ever coming close to you. [Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zbjcunxz4/)
