We have 1 coming soon and 1 open now and 1 tip. These updates are offering some great tasting treats. I'm breaking a rule on this post, hopefully you don't hold it against me.

## Decadent - Fulton
With locations sprinkled across five other states, this location is the first one to come to Maryland. Decadent is a coffee and dessert bar. Expected to open in December.

## Ssong's Hotdog - Columbia
This store in the mall is offering an interesting take on corn dogs. This franchise from Korea seems to be the first store in the US. They are now open. It replaces the crepe place on the 2nd floor near the merry-go-round.

## Gaver Farm - Mt Airy (not HoCo)
Please forgive me that this isn't inside our wonderful Howard County lines but it is very close. This is the closest place to find fresh homemade apple cider donuts (that I know of). It has become a tradition of ours to get some every year. With fall already well underway, it is a must to get some. I recommend just 10 seconds in the microwave to get it soft and warm. Pair it with a coffee and you are in heaven.
