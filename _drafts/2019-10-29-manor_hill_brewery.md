Mrs. Nom Nom and I are not big drinkers. Social drinkers at most. Unfortunately, I won't talk much about drinks when talking about places we go visit. But today is not the case. We went to a place that has all sorts of beer. And may I add, it had some of the smoothest tasting beer I have ever had. Although this is not a restaurant, we still had an amazing night out. When you get a chance go to Manor Hill Brewery in Columbia.

Getting to Manor Hill Brewery is pretty easy. It does require reservations, but you can easily sign up on their [website](https://manorhillbrewing.com/reservations/#id=tap-room-visit-ellicott-city). Warning, it is only open Friday and Saturdays. When you arrive, you drive down a long driveway that shows you the picturesque setting of Manor Hill Farm. Cows are grazing to the left of you and corn fields are to the right. This 54 acre piece of land is owned by the Marriner family who own Victoria's Gastro Pub, Food Plenty, and Manor Hill Tavern.

Inside the "Tap Room" is where there is a large space with a fairly long bar. Small tables made from barrels are conveniently placed around the area. Outside are a few long plastic picnic tables with a corn hole set. Although it isn't a restaurant, you can bring your own food or even get it delivered there. We picked up a few sandwiches before we arrived and brought it over.

Our first trip to the bar, Mrs. Nom Nom got a sampler allowing three 5oz samples. I got a 16oz as I knew exactly what I wanted, the Jousting Windmill. I highly recommend any of the Jousting Windmills. This line of beer contains real fruit grown on their farms. It's a sweeter beer that they experiment with different fruit combinations. My favorite combination is strawberry, apricot, vanilla. Taking a sip of some of Mrs. Nom Nom's sampler made me get my second pour. I chose Hayes Creek, a smooth pale ale with a hint of citrus. It was so smooth and easy to drink (Blue Moon fans, try this one).

The beers at Manor Hill Brewery are great but the relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff made it an incredible night. Perfect choice for an outing with a group of friends or coworkers. For those that miss out on a reservation. You can still show up to purchase cans or growlers to go. Make sure to check their website for what's available.
