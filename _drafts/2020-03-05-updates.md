Here are the latest updates: an Indian restaurant that just opened, a deli that's coming soon, and an American fare restaurant that just closed.

## Chick-Fil-A - Proposed / Double T - ? - Ellicott City

Thanks to Dan on twitter, remember that [rumor of a Chick-fil-a on route 40]({% post_url 2019-11-07-updates %})? Well it is one step more than a rumor. They are looking to build in the Forest Green Princess Shopping Center. Surprisingly, what does this mean for Double T Diner? Unfortunately it doesn't look good, as the plan is to raze the existing building.

## Akira Ramen & Izakaya - Open Today - Columbia

The wait is over. Today, March 5 at 5pm, is the soft opening of Akira Ramen in Columbia near the mall. The next day they will be open earlier for lunch. There has been a lot of anticipation for this restaurant opening, glad it's finally here.
