An interesting week here at Howard County. A celebrity chef has been spotted and a lot of secrecy is going on in Old Ellicott City. We have another unexpected closure of a long running restaurant. And a new restaurant with a curious name.

## Main Street Revival - Ellicott City

A lot of secrecy is going on in Old Ellicott City this week. Parking lots are closed, streets are shut down, shuttles are being provided, and a celebrity has been spotted. Gordon Ramsay is in town and he brought a couple of his "Hell on Wheels" trucks. [Reddit users report](https://www.reddit.com/r/ellicottcity/comments/f90zc3/gordon_ramsey/) work is being done at the Little Market Cafe, Ellicott Mills Brewery, and Phoenix Emporium. Definitely can't wait to see what happens.

## The Periodic Table - Columbia

Back in May 2019, Centre Park Grill closed from a small kitchen fire. The sign is still up and [it's even reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbiaMD/comments/f8e4rp/centre_park_dr_at_108/filenjz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that the tables inside are still set. After such a sudden exit and almost a year later, a new restaurant will be tacking its place. It will be called The Periodic Table. I have to say that I'm already very curious just by the name itself. Does anyone have anymore info about this place?
