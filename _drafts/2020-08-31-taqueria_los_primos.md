Have you ever asked where can I get the best tacos? It's a legit request. And if wherever you're at, the answer is Taco Bell, then I'm very sorry for where you are. So where's the best place to get tacos in Howard County? I have the place for you in today's post. And they are mouth watering.

Disclaimer: The Nom Nom family have snarfed down Taco Bell and we regularly do a taco night. But they are no way even close to what authentic Mexican tacos are like. With our untuned taste, take our recommendation with a grain of salt but Taqueria Los Primos is what I would say is the best tacos in Howard County.

I'm very happy to see that they are expanding. Now with 2 brick and mortar locations and 3 trucks. The newest addition is a truck in Ellicott City parked in the back of a gas station. The menu is pretty extensive and is plastered across the side of the truck.
