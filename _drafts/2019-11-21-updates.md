Today's updates have some interesting locations coming up. We have a pizza place that will have a self service tap for beer and wine. Hot Pot where you cook your own food right in front of you with your own small pot. And a place that you throw sharp axes at a wall.

## Neo Pizza - Columbia

A new pizza place is coming to McGaw Rd. I think this is replacing the Cheeburger Cheeburger location (I have PTSD of the 1lb challenge). Set to open January 2020. They'll provide artisan pizzas and paninis. A cool thing they say will have is a self-service tap for beer and wine. I've never seen that before. This will be the third Neo Pizza location as the others are in Annapolis and Bel Air.

## Urban Hot Pot - Columbia

This one isn't too much of a shocker since [Akira Ramen]({% post_url 2019-09-12-updates %}) is opening up just a couple doors down. In Rockville, these businesses share owners and are also next to each other. Urban Hot Pot will provide all you can eat chinese style fondue. I don't know of a better way to describe hot pot but it is great to have in the winter time.

## Stumpyâ€™s Hatchet House - Columbia

This isn't a restaurant but I find it really interesting. An axe throwing place will be opening right next to Frisco's Tap House. You'll be able to get drinks and throw axes. Just typing those two things together sound like a really bad idea. But they have other locations already so it's proven to work elsewhere.

## Burger King - Columbia

Reports from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColumbiaMD/comments/dytjn4/burger_king_reopening_at_columbia_centre_park/) are saying that Burger King is coming back to the Columbia Palace shopping center. Strange since they were there before and closed down not too long ago. Pop Pop Nom Nom is going to really like this update.
