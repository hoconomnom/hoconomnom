Maple Lawn is expanding. Which means more lovely restaurants. Here are some of the recent announcements in the area.

## Maiwand Kabob - Fulton

Maiwand Kabob will be opening up their 6th location in the maple lawn district. This Afghani restaurant started in Columbia and is definitely a can't miss. They have very good kabob platters.

## Galliano Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar - Fulton

We now have just a little more information as the opening of this restaurant is coming soon (predicted this month). Galliano Italian Restaurant in Fulton will be offering an upscale dining experience. They will be in a brand new 4,700 square foot place and have a 1,200 square foot patio.

## Sunset Raw Juice Bar - Fulton

A smoothie and juice bar will be opening up in the new building 11710 Market Place. This will be the same building where [Decadent]({% post_url 2019-10-31-updates %}) will be. I can only assume, as of now, that this will be the same as the place in Owings Mills. They will be offering healthy smoothies and acai bowls.
