## Pho 5Up - Scaggsville - Coming Soon

A tip from reddit user crepuscula, this pho place will be adding it's third location right in Scaggsville. Their other locations, in Annapolis and Crofton, seem to be highly reviewed. It's nice to see a pho place outside of the concentrated Snowden/Dobbin area.

## Sizzle Kabob - Ellicott City - Closed

Unfortunately, another restaurant closure. From reader Kathy B, Sizzle Kabob in Ellicott City has closed.
