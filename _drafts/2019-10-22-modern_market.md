Once we had Little Nom, our life changed. One of those things were how we decide what to get for dinner. Mrs. Nom Nom and I have very similar taste buds and we love every type of food. Little Nom did not get that trait. So when there's a place that gets Little Nom's stamp of approval, you know it's a keeper. Modern Market is one of of our favorite places to go as a family for dinner.

Inside there is plenty of seating. Their relaxed open environment makes it very friendly and inviting. Little Nom loves the space.

Modern Market does offer one of the most amazing deals that we frequently take advantage of. Kid's eat free Sunday and Monday nights (with an adult entree purchase). For those of you with young families out there, get out to Modern Market and enjoy the time together.
