The new construction in Merriweather is adding a lot of opportunities for businesses. With the big announcement of Busboys & Poets comes the announcement of three more restaurants. The area is filling out nicely with more shops to come.

## Matchbox - Columbia
This restaurant should be pretty familiar. It will be the first one in Howard County but there are plenty of locations around the DC metro area. Their wood fire pizzas are great.

## Dok Khao Thai Eatery - Columbia
This will be a Thai restaurant. For those that want to try out this restaurant (and don't mind driving), they will have a location opening in Woodbridge, VA very soon.
