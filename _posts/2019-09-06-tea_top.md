Some may say it's still trending, some say we're at the peak, others say it's over. Nevertheless, bubble tea is still going strong on [Korean Way](https://www.marylandkoreanway.com/). You either hate it or you love it. I love it. We've had a an explosion of choices pop up on but my favorite is **Tea Top**.

Tucked in the back of the Enchanted Forest shopping center, this cute little shop offers an extensive list of drinks: slushies, milk teas and fruit teas. What sets it apart is the quality and freshness of the tea and the sweet marination of the tapioca balls. Tea Top has expanded its menu just a little bit to include some food. The main ones that ppopcorn chicken or minced pork over rice is available.

The inside of the shop is great. A huge flower wall decorates the right side of the store. There is plenty of seating around where you easily find groups of friends hanging out or people working on their laptops. Little Nom loves to grab one of the many board games to play.
