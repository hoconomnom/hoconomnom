Happy 2021 everyone! We're finally rolling out some vaccines. Please go to [pre-register here](http://vaccine.howardcountymd.gov/) and see if you qualify for early vaccination.

Other great news is that the 10pm curfew for restaurants will be lifted on Feb 1.

Here are the latest openings on places we've blogged before about: [THB Columbia]({% post_url 2020-02-21-updates %}), [BurgerFi]({% post_url 2020-09-30-updates %}).

## The Hoagie House - Ellicott City - Open Now

This virtual restaurant offers a variety of hot and cold subs. They work out of the same kitchen at the Bagel Bin in the Enchanted Forest Shopping Center in Ellicott City. 

Owner Jake Spain is proud to serve top quality steaks, 3/4lb or Roseda Farms Dry-Aged Tri-Tip, for each 12" sandwiches. Little Nom is excited to try their quesadilla which is huge, served on a gigantic tortilla.

Just a reminder that you don't have to use a delivery service, they do offer curbside pickup / carry out.
