How can you not love the mall food court? There would always be that stand that would have a tray full of chicken and the workers would pander free samples on toothpicks. At our mall, there's at least 4 stands that do that. One of those stands is always a Hibachi fast food. People love that chicken. Well it's no surprise, a Hibachi fast food chain is making it's way into Howard County. That and some closing updates in today's updates.

## Rams Head Tavern - Closed - Savage

I'm super late for this one. But it deserves a write up because Rams Head Tavern has been an iconic part of Historic Savage Mill. The staple restaurant closed its doors a couple months ago. They have been around for 20 years. Rams Head Tavern still has 5 other locations in Annapolis, Glen Burnie, Crownsville, Stevensville and Key West, Fl.
