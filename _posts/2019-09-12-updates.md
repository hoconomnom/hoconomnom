I'm excited to announce these upcoming restaurants coming to the Howard County area.  All of them are local chains that have established themselves in nearby cities but not yet in Howard County.

## Jumbo Jumbo Cafe - Ellicott City
The sign has already gone up and they are opening soon. They will be on the northbound of Route 40 just west of the 29 exit. This Taiwanese cafe serves great food and bubble tea. Their staple is Taiwanese Chicken. They started in Rockville and now have numerous locations around the area.

## Akira Ramen - Columbia
This place is still around 6 months out but it is well worth the wait. They make a great bowl of ramen. They will be opening up in the Columbia Mall area across the parking lot where Halal Guys, Coldstone, and BonChon are. Their main store in Rockville is very popular and they just opened another in Canton.

## GrillMarx - Columbia
This steakhouse and raw bar is the third restaurant in Maryland. I haven't tried this place before but I certainly can't wait as I've heard decent things about their other locations. They'll be setting up shop close to the lakefront.

## Busboys & Poets - Columbia
I am very excited to hear about this one. This DC chain is very well known with numerous locations sprinkled around DC and surrounding areas. Columbia will be the farthest away from the city but will be the largest store they have. The atmosphere is amazing here but the real benefit is how involved they are with the community. I can't wait for the type of events that will be hosted here. The area is still in construction so I expect the earliest it would open is summer 2020.
