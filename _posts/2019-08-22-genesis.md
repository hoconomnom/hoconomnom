Hello, thanks so much for checking out this blog. Our family has grown up in Howard County for decades. We love it here and love to share what there is to offer. I'm hoping that this blog helps to bring awareness of the many great food options.

First off, I am not an expert on anything. I am just an average joe that likes anything that tastes nom nom =) You will find me just as easily eating a filet-o-fish as... well, let's just say I really like my fast food. But as I'm finding new places and foods to try, I want to share that with you because what's life if not sharing it with someone.

Secondly, this is not a review site. What I mean by that is that my goal is to provide information, announcements, and rumors of restaurants but I am not here to criticize or complain about a certain experience. There are plenty of sites that you can go to if you would like to hear about that. So I ask that if you are commenting, please stay positive and if you don't have anything good to say, take it somewhere else.

Lastly, I would like to mention and give a big kudos to the [HowChow blog](http://howchow.blogspot.com). I hope that this blog is somewhat of a continuation of what the HowChow blog has done for the area. 

Have any tips, thoughts or words of encouragement? How'd you find me? Let me know in the comments below or email me at <a href="mailto:hoconomnom@gmail.com">hoconomnom@gmail.com</a>.
