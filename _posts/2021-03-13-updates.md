Wow, may I claim that winter is finally over? We've had amazing weather this week and I don't know about you, but it definitely feels like pre-covid times. This Sunday, daylight savings time occurs so we get a little bit more sunshine later in the day. 

Have you gotten your vaccine yet? Although I've heard that it's tough to get an appointment. Hopefully things will be ramping up soon with a 3rd vaccine coming into supply.

Here are the latest openings on places we've blogged before about: [Clove and Cardamom]({% post_url 2019-10-24-updates %}).

## Pho 5Up - Scaggsville - Open

A tip from reddit user crepuscula, this pho place will be adding it's third location right in Scaggsville. Their other locations, in Annapolis and Crofton, seem to be highly reviewed. It's nice to see a pho place outside of the concentrated Snowden/Dobbin area.
