Summer during COVID-19 is not fun. With the Howard County Fair cancelled, we'll miss out on the farm animals, rides, and games. But there is one thing that you won't miss out on... carnival food. We've found it: sausages, cheese fries, funnel cake, corn dogs, shakes, sundaes, soft serve and freshly squeezed lemonade. Everything that will fill my arteries for the next 50 years but totally worth it. Summer has arrived and it's name is Goertze's Dairy Kone.

Goertze's Dairy Kone has become the Nom Nom family's guilty pleasure. This traveling concession stand has parked at the Howard County Fairgrounds and opens up during the weekends. For those in Western Howard County, this is a great dessert oasis.

Drive down Fairground Rd and when you reach the end, you'll see a brightly lit ice cream cone. When you walk up to the two carts. The left, Lennyâ€™s Ethnic Sausage, is for your fried stuff: sausage, funnel cake, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries. The right side, Gortze's Dairy Kone, is for your desserts: ice cream, sundaes, root bear floats, milk shakes. 

For Coronavirus precautions, they've spray painted convenient markings to stand in line with plenty of space in-between. Masks are highly recommended and all their staff are wearing them. There's also a big bottle of Purell on the counter of Lenny's truck. Tables with umbrellas are setup on the sides where you can relax and enjoy your food.

I am a sucker for funnel cake, so this is heaven for me. The whole family will share one. I've had my fair share of bad funnel cakes, but the one here at Lenny's cart is perfect. It's the size of the entire paper plate, good thickness, and made to order so it's nice and hot. Little Nom gets the soft serve where they have chocolate and/or vanilla and a flavor of the week (black raspberry the times we've been). The soft serve is great and hits the spot on these summer days.

Make your way to Goertze's to satisfy that summer craving. If you happen to be there when the Nom Nom family is there, you'll get a show as well. Little Nom loves dancing to the 50s music that plays through the loud speaker. Their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DairyKone/) posts what days they open and their hours.
