Here's a couple of new openings that sprung up in the area during the past month or two. The last restaurant is now open at the Common Kitchen and a fast food wings place has opened up in Columbia.

## Foodfricana - Clarksville

The Soft Opening has already happened on Saturday 12/31/19 and they are now open for business. The food is looking amazing. Can't wait to try their Jollof Rice and Beef. This marks the last vendor to open in the Common Kitchen.

## America's Best Wings - Columbia

This chain has it's first store in Howard County but they are everywhere in Baltimore and DC. America's Best Wings have opened up in Harper's Choice Village Center off of Harpers Farm Rd. They offer a huge selection of wings. They are now open, between Maiwand Kabob and Bank of America.

## Burger King - Columbia

Pop Pop Nom Nom has reported that the Burger King [mentioned here]({% post_url 2019-11-21-updates %}) has opened. Located northeast of the Columbia Palace shopping center off of Centre Park Dr. I wouldn't be surprised if he was there opening day, waiting for the doors to open.

Correction (01/16/20): The location of Burger King incorrectly stated it was within the Columbia Palace shopping center but rather northeast of the shopping center. Also links for America's Best Wings have been corrected.
