We have a new sushi place, a bubble tea chain growing, and a confirmed rumor that we had before. I'm getting better at finding new updates and places but I still could use your help. If you have any tips or rumors, please let me know.

## Sushi Q7 - Jessup

Sushi Q7 will be opening in Jessup. This chain of sushi restaurants have been pretty popular, assuming this is the 7th one. We've been to both Sushi Q and Sushi Q2 and they both have been great. This new one will be right on Rt. 1 just north of the intersection with Rt. 32. They will be in the same shopping center as Popeye's and Jimmy Johns.

## Gong Cha - Clarksville

I spoke too soon about no more restaurant updates at The Common Kitchen. Gong Cha will be opening in the Common Kitchen in Clarksville. Soon to be opening this spring, this chain has been springing up all over the area. They provide bubble tea from Taiwan. This will be the second store in Howard County. They will be replacing the counter that RoyalTea occupies.

UPDATE (2020-08-19): RoyalTea will be staying and Gong Cha will not be replacing it.

It is confirmed, Pizza Hut will be taking over the space of Pie Five in Ellicott City.
