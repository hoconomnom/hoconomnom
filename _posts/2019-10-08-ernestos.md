It's not everyday that Howard County is the second choice for a restaurant that hit success somewhere else in the country. But this restaurant is just that. Ernesto's mexican restaurant came from Texas when the owner's nephew moved to the area. And with that move came this great Tex-Mex establishment.

Located in the established Enchanted Forest shopping center, Ernesto's provides a great dining experience with their super friendly staff and good food. Ernesto's is everything you come to expect from the free chips and salsa, table prepared guacamole, and the every now and then Feliz Cumpleanos sung while delivering a tasty fried ice cream to the birthday boy/girl. The casual atmosphere is great. Little Nom enjoys stealing all the nachos and fills up before their meal even comes.

Here are our go tos. I get the chicken flautas entree. Mrs. Nom Nom gets the choose any two items platter. Little Nom Nom gets a quesadilla and fries. We've never had a bad meal here. The portions are hefty and I never am able to finish my whole meal. The one thing that I can't get enough of is their refried beans. It is the best refried beans that I've had anywhere. Definitely make sure that you have it.

For the Columbia folks, they have opened a second location right in Shipley's Grant.
