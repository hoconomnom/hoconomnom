Ramen has always been near and dear to Mrs. Nom Nom and mine's heart. But without a place to go in Howard County, we would be forced to travel to Rockville or Wheaton to satisfy our cravings. When this restaurant opened, we couldn't be happier. This was one of the first ramen only restaurants in Howard County. The timing was just right, as ramen shops were beginning to become popular. Uma Uma opened off of route 40 in Ellicott City to fill the ramen void.

[Uma Uma's backstory](https://www.howardcc.edu/about-us/news-events/news/hcc-alum-to-give-back-with-scholarship-at-entrepreneurial-celebration) is an intriguing one, founded by Emily Kim, a Mount Hebron High and HCC alum. The restaurant was initially conceptualized by Kim through an entrepreneurship program at the University of Baltimore. It's great to see such young entrepreneurship being fostered and supported in the area. A great role model for Little Nom. If Little Nom doesn't open their own restaurant by 22, then I'm a failure of a parent.

When you walk inside the restaurant, you first get a glimpse of the inside through a quant little square window. Peering in you can see a comfortable modest setup with wooden booths to the left and table seating to the right. The high booths are a great touch of japanese seating, giving you a very intimate experience.

Mrs. Nom Nom and I dived straight into the ramen, tonkotsu ramen. The hot bowl was a perfect way to warm up your belly from the cold nights we've been having. The broth is good and egg is cooked perfectly (I like it cooked a little more than most). Little Nom loves their dumplings (maybe one day we will have a Little Nom dumpling ranking). I really liked the presentation of the dumplings, served upside down with a drizzle of eel(?) sauce.

Uma Uma has been a great staple of ramen here in Howard County. Make your way over this winter season, you will not regret it.
