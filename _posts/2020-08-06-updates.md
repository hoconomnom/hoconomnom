A lot of progress is being made on new construction shopping centers. Our latest news is about a shopping center in Clarksville. We know of three chains that are moving in. See the latest updates all in today's post.

## River Hill Square - Clarksville

Construction has been fast on this one. Buildings are up and the first tenant (SECU bank) is already open. There are plenty of spaces still up for lease but so far we have some chain restaurants committed to the area. Of the list: Five Guys, Starbucks and Cold Stone Creamery. Route 108 near 32 is going to be a pretty congested area in the near future.

## Lakeview Retail Center - Columbia

Chipotle is the first restaurant to setup shop in this upcoming shopping center. To be built across Broken Land Parkway from Lake Elkhorn. Let's keep an eye out on this one as plenty more stores will make their way over.

## Menya Hosaki - Closing - Annapolis Junction

It is a sad day but it was no surprise. Menya Hosaki the ramen pop-up shop is re-locating to the Petworth neighborhood in D.C. Their last day will be this Saturday 8/8. This restaurant was the [first review]({% post_url 2019-08-23-menya_hosaki_ramen %}) on this site a year ago. It is sad to see them go but they are on to bigger and brighter things. All the best to Eric Yoo.
