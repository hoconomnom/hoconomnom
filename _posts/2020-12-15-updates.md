We here at the Nom Nom household can't wait for tomorrow... the much anticipated first accumulating snow of the season. It's been awhile since we've had some significant snowfall. For Once, the snow isn't the only reason for us to be trapped at home.

As this year comes to a close, we just want to reflect on how crazy of a year this was. There have been plenty of highs and lows but our Howard County community has been resilient. Please continue to support our local restaurants by carrying out. Continue to stay strong, be safe, and soon things will get back to "normal". Happy Holidays everyone! We'll see you in the new year.

Here are the latest openings on places we've blogged before about: [Royal Farms]({% post_url 2020-09-02-updates %}).

## Cajun Seafood Boil - Laurel

Looking for a good seafood boil? This new take out place opened up a couple of months ago. They replaced Asian One in the Patuxent Square Residence & Shops off of Rte. 1 in Laurel. Early reviews are very good. I need to make my way down.

## The Columbia Cafe - Elkridge

Last month this Halal cafe opened up in the shopping center with Zips and CVS, off of Waterloo Rd. They offer plenty of offerings from sandwiches, wraps, burgers, wings, and smoothies.

## Houlihan's - Closed - Elkridge

For more than 13 years in Howard County, this staple was a great place for American fare. I remember going to this location for many birthdays and special occasions. With a message posted on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HoulihansColumbiaMD) on November 30 states:

> Thank you to all our guests who have supported us over the last 13+ years. We are honored to have been a part of your family dinners, your date nights and your many celebrations. Sadly, we must announce the permanent closure of Houlihanâ€™s Columbia. A very special thank you to our extended family, the wonderful men and women who have worked tirelessly through this most difficult time to continue to bring great food and drink to our guests.       Be well and stay safe.
