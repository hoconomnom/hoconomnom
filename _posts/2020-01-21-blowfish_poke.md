The Common Kitchen in Clarksville added another healthy option to it's army. Setup right across from Trifecto Bar, this vendor provides healthy customized poké bowls. Poké is a Hawaiian dish featuring small diced raw fish (for the non raw fish eaters, do not worry, they have you covered). I am a big fan of poké and when poké bowls started becoming a trend, I couldn't wait til they made their way here. Blowfish Poké is now open for business in Howard County, filling our bellies with yummy fish.

The moment you arrive to Blowfish Poké, your eyes immediately draw to the vibrant colors of the ingredients. Solid colors of orange, pink, purple, and green are laid out gorgeously in front of you. They make it very simple for you to construct a bowl in 4 easy steps, with no limit to what you choose. The owner was super nice walking me through all the ingredients and recommendations. You can choose two sizes Regular or Large. I just got a regular bowl but there was soooo much there.

The bowls and flavors at this place are delicious. Mrs. Nom Nom couldn't stop taking from my bowl. I don't blame her. The ingredients seemed to go very well together and the sauces were spot on. If you haven't yet had a poké bowl before, this is a must go for you.
