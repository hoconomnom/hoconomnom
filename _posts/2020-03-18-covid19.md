During this Coronavirus pandemic, restaurant closure mandates, and troubling economy, it is tough for our restaurants. Here's some of the extra things our food community is doing during these tough times. I'll try to keep this post updated when I come across more things.

* **Beef Brothers Deli** - Offering No Contact Curbside pick up. If you order online or on the phone, pay in advance, and describe the car. Just pop the trunk when you arrive and someone with gloves will deliver your food and place it in the trunk for you without ever coming close to you. [Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zbjcunxz4/)
