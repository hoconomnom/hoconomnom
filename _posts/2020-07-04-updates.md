Happy Birthday America!

It's been a wild ride since the last post.  Restaurants are now open for outdoor seating and indoor seating at 50% capacity. It's been great seeing all of us wearing masks and doing our part to keeping everyone safe. Having two small Nom Noms is really kicking our butts. We are doing well though. 

There's been a lot of news since we've been gone. Here are the latest updates in one giant update post.

## Now Open

### Sushi Call - Elkridge

This restaurant has opened up and initial reviews have been pretty good. Located in the Elkridge Corners shopping center where Green Valley and Cindy's Soft Serve are.

## Coming Soon

### EC Diner - Ellicott City

A new diner will be replacing the Double T diner in Ellicott City. The announcement came from owners: Spiros Korologos (510 Johnny's) and John Kanellopoulos (By The Docks). It seems that the announcement of a potential Chick-fil-a may have sparked this endeavor.

### Kyoto Matcha - Ellicott City

This is one the Nom Nom family is really looking forward to.  Kyoto Matcha will be opening in the location of the Kung Fu Tea in the Princess shopping center. They offer a great matcha green tea soft serve. I admit, the Nom Nom family has made numerous field trips to Rockville for this place.

### Normandy Shopping Center - Ellicott City

A huge facelift is coming for the much needed Normandy Shopping Center.  It's the oldest shopping center in Howard County. After the construction, plenty of great restaurants will be moving in. Keep an eye out for more as there's still available plots for leasing.

### Dae Bok BBQ - Ellicott City

A new Korean BBQ place will open at the existing location where Tongnamoo House once was. This place has been closed since the restaurant caught fire in December 2017.

## Closings

### Clydes and The Soundry - Closing July 19th - Columbia

Both Clyde's and The Soundry will be closing. Clyde's has been there for 45 years but the lakefront is a tough location to own a restaurant. Redevelopment of the area has already begun and will hopefully give new life for the restaurants that are still there.

### Cravin' - Closed - Columbia

The char-broiled chicken place at Snowden Crossing has closed. The shopping center is getting pretty empty at this time with only Starbucks and Charm City Run holding the fort.

### Panera Bread - Closed - Columbia

The Panera Bread inside the mall on the second floor near Nordstrom has closed. If a Panera Bread can close in Columbia than no restaurant is safe. Does anyone know why?
