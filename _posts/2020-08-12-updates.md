Plant based burgers? The jury is still out for me. My only experience is an Impossible Burger from SeaWorld. I blame the experience itself more than the meal for the lackluster impression. We were huddled under cover from a downpour while Little Nom was shooing away the hungry Ibis. I was more focused on keeping Little Nom from waging a turf war with the native flock than I was eating. But I'll have another chance to try as a new established has opened up inside Whole Foods.

## PLNT Burger - Columbia

The burger bar that was situated inside Whole Foods has transformed into PLNT Burger. It is an interesting concept that serves only plant based burgers, sausages, and chili. I literally work down the street so you know I will be hitting this place up when things turn back to normal. And for those that need to further indulge, Oat Milk Soft Serve.

For those that have been, what happened to the coffee bar and original grill? I'd be sad to see those go. I would always get my regular quota of tater tots fulfilled there.

## Taqueria Los Primos Food Truck - Ellicott City

This one was brought to attention by [Strobist](https://strobist.blogspot.com/), an experienced Howard County blogger and world renowned photographer. 

Taqueria Los Primos has been parking their food truck at this Mobil gas station recently. This is my favorite taco place. They do have a brick and mortar restaurant in Laurel just within Howard County lines. If you haven't been, you are missing out! Al Pastor tacos and a Horchata for the win.

## Panera Bread - Fulton

Panera Bread is coming to Maple Lawn. Nothing really more to say about Panera Bread. You know what it is, I know what it is. That is all. They'll be right across the parking lot from Harris Teeter.
