We have a couple of openings over at the Clarksville Kitchen. Also, if you didn't know we're trying to complete a listing of places that are open during the holiday hours. Check out the [Holiday Hours Page](/holidays2019.html). We won't have any posts next week but I'll try to keep the holiday hours page updated.
