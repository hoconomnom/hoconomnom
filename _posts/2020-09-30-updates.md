Howdy Folks, today's update mainly consists of closures. What a downer right? Before we get into it, I just want to mention a few places that have opened now: [Starbucks in Clarksville]({% post_url 2020-08-06-updates %}), [Mikey & Mel's in Fulton]({% post_url 2020-07-18-updates %}) and [Kyoto Matcha in Ellicott City]({% post_url 2020-07-04-updates %}). Now let's just get this over with, just like ripping off a band-aid.

## Ruby Tuesday - Closed - Columbia

The Ruby Tuesday has abruptly closed down it's location in the Snowden Square Shopping Center. The restaurant has been there since the start of the shopping center over 20 years ago. The Ruby Tuesday chain has been declining even before Covid-19 but the pandemic has caused the company to close more stores than originally forecast.

BurgerFi will be replacing Modern Market in the Dobbin Station Shopping Center. The franchise came to Maryland in 2018 but this will be the first location in Howard County.
