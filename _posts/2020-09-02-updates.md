Summer is ending. We got thru this together. This season was especially hard with COVID-19 throwing everyone's vacation plans out the door. The silver lining is that the governor has now begun [Phase 3](https://governor.maryland.gov/2020/09/01/governor-hogan-announces-beginning-of-stage-three-of-marylands-covid-19-recovery-additional-safe-and-gradual-reopenings/) of the COVID-19 Recovery plan. Today's posts contains some updates happening on Snowden River Parkway, a new bubble tea place, and an event on the fairgrounds.

## Tiger Sugar - Ellicott City

This is a well known bubble tea place that comes from Taiwan. They have notable locations in many Asia countries and looks like they are beginning to expand their US locations. I find it pretty surprising to see Los Angeles, New York, Vegas, and now... Ellicott City =) We've joined the big leagues folks! All kidding aside, Tiger Sugar looks like they specialize in Brown Sugar Bubble Tea. The way they drizzle the sugar to look like stripes across the cup is pretty cool looking. Can't wait to try. Their store is in the Village Green Shopping Center off of Rt. 40. Should be coming mid September.

## Royal Farms - Coming Soon - Columbia

Construction has been underway. Royal Farms will be coming to the corner of Snowden River Parkway and Minstrel Way. Well known for their convenient and fast fried chicken. We love getting their family sized wedge fries.

## Starbucks - Columbia

The Starbucks off of Snowden River Parkway near the Supreme Sports Club just got approved by the planning board to have a drive-thru. Making it even more convenient to get your caffeine fix.

## Fair Food Drive Thru Event - West Friendship

The Howard County Fair Food Drive-Thru got extended and will be back again this weekend. Basically sit in your car, fill out a paper slip with the menu on it, and just like that you can have things like: krisy kreme doughnut cheeseburgers, loaded tots, cheesesteak eggrolls, fried oreos, funnel cake, and cotton candy.
