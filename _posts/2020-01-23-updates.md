The Common Kitchen has been a staple to this website. It always had news to report, as it always had space for more vendors. The time has come that they have reached capacity. I'll be sad, as I won't be able to rely on them for restaurant updates anymore. 

Today, we announce restaurant week, an event this saturday and a certain axe place opening.

## Restaurant Week - Howard County

It's Restaurant Week!!!! Actually, more like restaurant weeks as it lasts almost two weeks. From January 20 - February 2. I have to admit, this actually snuck up on me... BAD MR. NOM NOM! I won't let this happen again. There are some great restaurants participating, especially a lot of the new ones, so now is a perfect time to try them out.
