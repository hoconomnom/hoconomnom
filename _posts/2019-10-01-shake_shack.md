Hailing from New York and started just as a hot dog cart, this chain has exploded in the past couple of years. Shake Shack came to Howard County as their 3rd installment in Maryland. They are located in the Columbia Mall across from the movie theatre.

The Shake Shack burger is amazingly simple. It consists of a toasted potato roll with lettuce, tomatoes, american cheese, and their shack sauce. The perfection comes with their patty. It's just the right amount of crispy on the outside from smashing their patty to the grill. It is an amazing burger that we love trying to replicate at home but nothing beats the real thing.

When we go, we love getting the burgers. Remember you can add more toppings, I add pickles and onions. Little Nom loves these burgers but they really attack the crinkle fries. Their lemonades and shakes are addictingly good and it takes shear will power to pass on them whenever we go (we never pass on them). If you do treat yourself to something sweet, the Columbia location will donate 5% of sales of the the Pie Oh My concrete to [Grassroots](http://www.grassrootscrisis.org/).

The outdoor seating area is a great touch and provides heat lamps when it gets too cold. There's ample seating and the large windows always remind me of Edward Hopper's [Nighthawks painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks_(painting)). Competition in the fast food burger market is fierce and Shake Shack is a heavy hitter.

Do you think Shake Shack has the best burgers?
