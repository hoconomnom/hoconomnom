Today is a crazy time, COVID-19 has been sweeping the nation. Governor Hogan has instructed restaurants to be closed but drive thru and carry out is allowed. County Executive Ball has already shut down the mall, any restaurants inside the mall without an outdoor entry will be closed. I can't imagine what a tough time this will be for restaurant staff and owners. Let's hope this passes quickly.

Some happy news, the Nom Nom family has gotten larger. Things are a bit hectic here in the Nom Nom house. I apologize that updates will be coming very infrequently in the short term. That aside, here are some updates.

## Chop Chop Salad - Columbia

A new healthy option is now open (well when the mall reopens) at the food court in the Columbia Mall. Chop Chop Salad is a build your own salad bowl. They took over the space of Bistro Sensations, next to the food court entrance. They offer a huge amount of choices and variety.

## The Food Market - Columbia

The Food Market, whose original location is in Hampden, will open up a second location in Columbia near the mall. Chad Gauss, owner and chef, serves up American fare and will have a brunch, lunch, and dinner menu. They will open on the ground floor of an office building, expected to open late 2020.
