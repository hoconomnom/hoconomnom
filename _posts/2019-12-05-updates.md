Not as many updates this time. I have a theory that the cold and the holidays are slowing down the amount of new announcements. Don't worry there are plenty of places still coming very soon. Check the [past updates](/categories/update/) in case you missed any. If you're all caught up, today's post has 1 new opening and 1 upcoming.

## Lewi Cafe - Ellicott City

This deli just opened. They offer plenty of sandwiches, wraps, and flatbreads. The best part is that this deli serves Ethiopian Coffee! They have one existing location in Silver Spring. They have moved into the old Snow Cafe location.

## Galliano Italian Restaurant & Wine Bar - Fulton

An Italian restaurant will be coming to Maple Lawn in Fulton. Not many details I can gather about this one and seems like it's an original concept. If anyone has more details, please reach out.
