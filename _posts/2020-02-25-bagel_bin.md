Our third post in our deli series. We travel again to Clarksville for a staple that's been in the area for nearly a decade. Inside the River Hill shopping center is this deli that makes their own bagels and has a wide variety of food options. The Bagel Bin and Deli is your go to spot for a quick breakfast or lunch.

When you step into Bagel Bin, you're stepping into a true deli. Nothing really too fancy, just a lot of seating and a lot of choices. When you come up to the counter, there is a lot going on in terms of eye grabbing items. Anything from bottled beverages, fruit cups, teas, and a huge variety of chips and other snacks. It's almost like a mini convenience store.

What is astounding is the amount of things you can get on the menu. Not only the typical breakfast sandwiches, omelets, and wraps that you would find at any breakfast deli. They also offer a nice selection of sandwiches, paninis, and subs. Mrs. Nom Nom and I both grabbed an egg salad sandwich on a supreme bagel. The egg salad was nice and airy and not too overpowering. The coffee was surprisingly smooth and it was free refills. Little Nom got mesmerized by the pastries they had in the glass counter. Cakes and cookies that looked like they were made from rainbows. Of course we had to get one, it's not everyday you eat something with that much color.

Overall the vibe of the Bagel Bin is nice and busy. It's loud and open where it's easy to just spark a conversation with someone next to you. That's what I love best about breakfast deli places. Bagel Bin definitely has that atmosphere.
