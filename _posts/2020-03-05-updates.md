## Akira Ramen & Izakaya - Columbia

The wait is over. Today, March 5 at 5pm, is the soft opening of Akira Ramen in Columbia near the mall. The next day they will be open earlier for lunch. There has been a lot of anticipation for this restaurant opening, I'm expected a pretty busy opening week for them. But glad it's finally here.

## Chick-Fil-A and Double T - Ellicott City

Thanks to Dan on twitter, remember that [rumor of a Chick-fil-a on route 40]({% post_url 2019-11-07-updates %})? Well, not a rumor anymore. They are looking to build in the Forest Green Princess Shopping Center. Surprisingly, what does this mean for Double T Diner? Unfortunately it doesn't look good, as the plan is to raze the existing building.

## Nothing Bundt Cakes and 7-eleven - Columbia

[The Merriweather Post](https://www.themerriweatherpost.org) (a great new blog, check it out) posted that two stores are slated for opening in the old Princeton Sports building in Columbia. Nothing Bundt Cakes will offer signature bundt cakes, small and large. This will be the third location in Maryland with more to come.
