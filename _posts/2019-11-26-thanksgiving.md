With Thanksgiving just a couple of days away, we'll be taking a break this week. I'm dreading that Boston Market line. Mrs. Nom Nom's family gets ham at [Honey Baked Ham](https://pickup.honeybaked.com/) in Ellicott City. Are there any food traditions or places you go during Thanksgiving? 

We just want to take a moment and say a big thank you to all the readers out there. It's amazing to get such a warm welcome from all of you. From the Nom Nom family to yours, have a great Thanksgiving. Eat lots of Nom Nom!
