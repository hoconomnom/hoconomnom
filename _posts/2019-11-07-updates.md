With the cold air now here, that's maybe why the amount of updates are cooling down. But we still have a bunch of restaurants and food among us. Here's the latest news. And a couple of firsts for the website, an event update this saturday and a submitted tip from a reader.

## Dunkin' Donuts - Columbia
A brand new Dunkin' Donuts will hold their grand opening this Saturday. They'll be giving away free coffee from 9am - 12pm. If you're the first 100 people you'll get a coupon book for free coffee for a year. Not too shabby. They'll also have a raffle and ribbon cutting ceremony. Seems like it'll be a great time.

## Chick-Fil-A - Ellicott City (Rumor)
This one came from one of our readers. Love that you guys are finding me. This one from Andy. The Pie Five on route 40 is closed and supposedly a sign is up for another pizza place. The rumor is that the Pizza Hut near Bethany Ln. will move there and Chick-Fil-A will open where the Pizza Hut currently is. If this is true, that Chick-Fil-A will be pretty popular. Thank you, Andy!
